/**
 * Wrapper class of the CompleteSale call of eBay SOAP API.
 * <br>
 * <p>Title: SOAP API wrapper library.</p>
 * <p>Description: Contains wrapper classes for eBay SOAP APIs.</p>
 * <p>Copyright: Copyright (c) 2009</p>
 * <p>Company: eBay Inc.</p>
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>ItemID</code> - Unique identifier for an eBay item listing. An <b>ItemID</b> can be paired up
 * with a corresponding <b>TransactionID</b> and used in the <b>CompleteSale</b> request
 * to identify a single line item order.
 * <br><br>
 * Unless an <b>OrderLineItemID</b> is used to identify a single line item order,
 * or the <b>OrderID</b> is used to identify a single or multiple line item
 * order, the <b>ItemID</b>/<b>TransactionID</b> pair must be
 * specified. For a multiple line item order, <b>OrderID</b>
 * must be used. If <b>OrderID</b> or <b>OrderLineItemID</b> are specified, the
 * <b>ItemID</b>/<b>TransactionID</b> pair is ignored if present in the same request.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>TransactionID</code> - Unique identifier for an eBay order line item (transaction). The
 * <b>TransactionID</b> can be paired up with the corresponding <b>ItemID</b> and used in
 * the <b>CompleteSale</b> request to identify a single line item order.
 * <br><br>
 * Unless an <b>OrderLineItemID</b> is used to identify a single line item order,
 * or the <b>OrderID</b> is used to identify a single or multiple line item
 * order, the <b>ItemID</b>/<b>TransactionID</b> pair must be
 * specified. For a multiple line item order, <b>OrderID</b>
 * must be used. If <b>OrderID</b> or <b>OrderLineItemID</b> are specified, the
 * <b>ItemID</b>/<b>TransactionID</b> pair is ignored if present in the same request.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>FeedbackInfo</code> - This container is used by the seller to leave feedback for the buyer for the
 * order line item identified in the call request. The seller must include and
 * specify all fields of this type, including the buyer's eBay User ID, the
 * Feedback rating (a seller can only leave a buyer a "Positive" rating), and a
 * comment, which helps justify the Feedback rating. The eBay User ID must match 
 * the buyer who bought the order line item, or an error will occur. An error will 
 * also occur if Feedback has already been left for the buyer (either through API 
 * or the Web flow).
 * <br><br>
 * To determine if Feedback has already been left for an order line item, you can 
 * call <b class="con">GetFeedback</b>, passing in the 
 * <b class="con">OrderLineItemID</b> value in the call request.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>Shipped</code> - The seller includes and sets this field to true if the order has been
 * shipped. If the call is successful, the order line item(s) are marked as
 * Shipped in My eBay.
 * <br><br>
 * If the seller includes and sets this field to false, the order line item(s)
 * are marked (or remain) as Not Shipped in My eBay.
 * <br><br>
 * If this field is not included, the shipped status of the order line
 * item(s) remain unchanged in My eBay.
 * <br><br>
 * If shipment tracking information is provided for an order line item through
 * the Shipment container in the same request, the order line item is marked as
 * shipped automatically and the <b>Shipped</b> field is not
 * required.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>Paid</code> - The seller includes and sets this field to true if the buyer has paid for
 * the order. If the call is successful, the
 * order line item(s) are marked as Paid in My eBay.
 * <br><br>
 * If the seller includes and sets this field to false, the order line item(s)
 * are marked (or remain) as Not Paid in My eBay.
 * <br><br>
 * If this field is not included, the paid status of the order line
 * item(s) remain unchanged in My eBay.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>ListingType</code> - This field is required if <b>CompleteSale</b> is being used for a Half.com
 * order. The value should be set to <i>Half</i>, which is the only applicable
 * <b>ListingType</b> value for this call.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>Shipment</code> - Container consisting of shipment tracking information, shipped time, and an
 * optional text field to provide additional details to the buyer. Setting the
 * tracking number and shipping carrier automatically marks the item as shipped
 * and the <b>Shipped</b> field is not required.
 * <br><br>
 * (If you supply <b>ShipmentTrackingNumber</b> you must also supply 
 * <b>ShippingCarrierUsed</b>, otherwise you will get an error.
 * <br><br>
 * To modify the shipping tracking number and/or carrier, supply the new number
 * in <b>ShipmentTrackingNumber</b> or supply the value for
 * <b>ShippingCarrierUsed</b> or both. The old number and carrier
 * are deleted and the new ones are added.
 * <br><br>
 * To simply delete the current tracking details altogether, supply empty
 * <b>Shipment</b> tags.
 * <br> 
 * <br>
 * <span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
 * Top-Rated sellers must have a record of uploading shipment tracking
 * information (through site or through API) for at least 90 percent of their order line
 * items (purchased by U.S. buyers) to keep their status as Top-Rated sellers. For more
 * information on the requirements to becoming a Top-Rated Seller, see the 
 * <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/top-rated.html">Becoming a Top-Rated Seller and qualifying for Top-Rated Plus</a> 
 * customer support page.
 * </span>
 * <br>
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>OrderID</code> - A unique identifier that identifies a single line item or multiple line
 * item order. 
 * <br><br> 
 * For a single line item order, the <b>OrderID</b> value is identical to the
 * <b>OrderLineItemID</b> value that is generated upon creation of the order line
 * item. For multiple line item orders, the <b>OrderID</b> value is created by eBay
 * when the buyer is purchasing multiple order line items from the same seller at the same time.
 * For multiple line item orders not going through the eBay Cart flow, a Combined Invoice order can be created by the seller
 * through the <b>AddOrder</b> call. The <b>OrderID</b> can be used in the <b>CompleteSale</b>
 * request to identify a single or multiple line item order.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>OrderID</b> overrides an <b>OrderLineItemID</b> or <b>ItemID</b>/<b>TransactionID</b> pair if
 * these fields are also specified in the same request.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>OrderLineItemID</code> - <b>OrderLineItemID</b> is a unique identifier for an eBay order line item and
 * is based upon the concatenation of <b>ItemID</b> and <b>TransactionID</b>, with a
 * hyphen in between these two IDs. For a single line item order, the
 * <b>OrderLineItemID</b> value can be passed into the <b>OrderID</b> field in the
 * <b>CompleteSale</b> request.
 * <br><br>
 * Unless an <b>ItemID</b>/<b>TransactionID</b> pair is used to identify a single line
 * item order, or the <b>OrderID</b> is used to identify a single or multiple line
 * item order, the <b>OrderLineItemID</b> must be specified.
 * For a multiple line item order, <b>OrderID</b> must be
 * used. If <b>OrderLineItemID</b> is specified, the <b>ItemID</b>/<b>TransactionID</b> pair are
 * ignored if present in the same request.
