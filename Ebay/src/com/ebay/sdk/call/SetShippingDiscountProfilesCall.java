 * Wrapper class of the SetShippingDiscountProfiles call of eBay SOAP API.
 * <br>
 * <p>Title: SOAP API wrapper library.</p>
 * <p>Description: Contains wrapper classes for eBay SOAP APIs.</p>
 * <p>Copyright: Copyright (c) 2009</p>
 * <p>Company: eBay Inc.</p>
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CurrencyID</code> - The three-digit code of the currency to be used for shipping cost discounts and
 * insurance for Combined Invoice orders. A discount profile can only be associated
 * with a listing if the <b>CurrencyID</b> value of the profile matches the 
 * <b>Item.Currency</b> value specified in a listing.
 * <br><br>
 * Required if the user creates flat rate shipping discount profiles, a promotional
 * discount, a packaging/handling cost profile based on a variable
 * discount rule, or if the user defines shipping insurance range/fee pairs.
 * <br><br>
 * Note: There is a currencyID attribute on many elements of SetShippingDiscountProfiles.
 * To avoid an error, be sure to use the same <b>CurrencyID</b> value 
 * in each occurrence within the same request.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CombinedDuration</code> - This field is used to specify the number of days after the sale of an
 * item in which the buyer or seller can combine multiple and mutual order
 * line items into one Combined Invoice order. In a Combined Invoice order,
 * the buyer makes one payment for all order line items, hence only unpaid
 * order line items can be combined into a Combined Invoice order.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>ModifyActionCode</code> - Indicates what action to take on the specified flat shipping discount,
 * calculated shipping discount or promotional discount.
 * If the action is Delete and if a flat rate or calculated shipping discount
 * profile is specified, the discount profile identified by
 * DiscountProfile.DiscountProfileID is deleted
 * (see DiscountProfile.MappedDiscountProfileID for related details).
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>FlatShippingDiscount</code> - Details of a shipping cost discount profile for flat rate shipping.
 * If this is provided, CalculatedShippingDiscount and PromotionalShippingDiscountDetails
 * should be omitted.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CalculatedShippingDiscount</code> - Details of a shipping cost discount profile for calculated shipping.
 * If this is provided, FlatShippingDiscount and PromotionalShippingDiscountDetails
 * should be omitted.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>CalculatedHandlingDiscount</code> - This container is used by the seller to specify/modify packaging and handling discounts that are applied 
 * for Combined Invoice orders.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>PromotionalShippingDiscountDetails</code> - The data for the promotional shipping discount.
 * If this is provided, FlatShippingDiscount and CalculatedShippingDiscount
 * should be omitted.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>ShippingInsurance</code> - Information establishing what fee to apply for domestic shipping insurance
 * for Combined Invoice depending on which range the order item-total price
 * falls into.
 * <br> <B>Input property:</B> <code>InternationalShippingInsurance</code> - Information establishing what fee to apply for international shipping
 * insurance for Combined Invoice depending on which range the order item-total
 * price falls into.
